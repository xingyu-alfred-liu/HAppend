We used the pre-generated FHI98PP pseudopotentials available on the Quantum Espresso website: https://pseudopotentials.quantum-espresso.org/legacy_tables/fhi-pp-from-abinit-web-site. 

More elements could be found on the website.

These pseudopotentials were originally generated using the FHI98PP code and subsequently converted into the UPS format for compatibility with Quantum Espresso.
